2) However, in this long process there are quite a few challenges, importers find it difficult to track products, to understand the place of origin and quality of the imported product, as the product moves between multiple stakeholders. 

3) There is a need for reforms in the food supply chain to enable India to reach out to its unrealized potential. Blockchain using food supply development services can provide greater visibility into complex steps in a food supply.

4) Any activity can be documented and stored in the distributed ledger only with consensus among all participating stakeholders, thus making the network more trustworthy than any individual entity. 

5) Untrusted stakeholders can transact amongs each other through smart contract without the need for a centralized body. Every stakeholder will have their own copy of the same distributed ledger which enables information access in near real time.
